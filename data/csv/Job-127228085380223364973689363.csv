143,197,Drug Screening of pNF Cell Lines,syn4939906,syn7850572,Completed,Partially Available,"A lack of cellular model systems was identified as a major gap in pNF therapeutics-focused research when NTAP was launched in 2012. Hence, creating a cell culture initiative was an early priority. While current animal models can faithfully mimic some aspects of pNF (tumor histology, imaging characteristics, natural history), they are based on relatively narrow genetically engineered platforms and are not fully representative of human NF1 diversity. Moreover, the tumors in these models are slow growing (requiring 9-12 months for a single compound efficacy study) and costly. Hence, there is a need for in vivo models that allow more rapid drug screening (particularly when considering possible combinatorial therapies) and a need for in vitro models that allow more facile manipulation of the NF1 gene in order to understand the molecular genomics influencing tumor behavior. The goal of this project is to create a panel of cell culture systems that represent pNF complexity and can be utilized to both screen new compounds as well as to identify new therapeutic targets.",Cell Culture Initiative,syn4939906,Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.,"If you use data from this study in a publication or talk, please cite the following publication: ""Ferrer M, Gosline SJC, Stathis M, et al.

PROs meeting FDA guidelines are critical to ensuring patient-centered endpoints are incorporated. Historically, NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas (pNF) treatment trials have under-utilized PROs specific to pNF. A psychometrically sound measure incorporating input from patients, families and clinicians, is critical for inclusion in treatment trials. To address the need for a pNF-specific PRO measure for use in clinical trials, this project sought to develop a PRO measurement system utilizing input from patients, families and clinicians, as well as well as psychometric analysis methods to ensure the developed measures are reliable and valid. Specifically this project designed a PRO system for children and young adults with pNF by (1) establishing a conceptual model describing HRQOL, 2) Developing item pools (e.g., pain, stigma, and organ dysfucntion measures), 3) Evaluating psychometric properties of the pools, 4) affirming clinical differences.",Patient Reported Outcomes,syn4939888,Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.,,"[""Jin-Shei Lai""]","[""Plexiform Neurofibroma""]","[""Northwestern University""]","[""Neurofibromatosis type 1""]","[""syn4939878"", ""syn4939880"", ""syn12051335""]","[""NTAP""]"

While the clinical aspects of NF1 are well characterized and the pathogenesis of plexiform neurofibromas has been widely studied, surprisingly little is known about the genetic and epigenetic changes in the NF1 mutant glioma. This has hindered the development of effective therapies for NF1-mutant cancers. To address this challenge and uncover the driver genes in NF1-glioma, The team will analyze whole-exome and transcriptome data from glioma samples of pediatric and adult NF1 patients. Alterations in the genetic networks will be contextualized in the natural genetic and cellular environment of a specific tumor, and the key driving modules on which specific NF1-glioma subgroups rely for growth, survival and progression will be identified. With this information in hand, we can target the critical alterations with specific drugs, often already available for other types of diseases. The specific aims are to (1) comprehensively characterize the genomic and epigenetic landscape of NF1 gliomas from patients of all age groups, (2) identify driver genetic alterations in NF1-gliomas from the integration of somatic copy number variations, mutations and gene fusions (translocations), (3) reconstruct a somatic alteration network for the inference of mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of genetic aberrations in NF1-gliomas and (4) validate the functional significance of the inferred alterations in neural systems in vitro and in vivo, and target therapeutically key genetic nodes with highly specific inhibitors.",Synodos,syn6633069,Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.,"If you use data from this study in a publication or talk, please cite the following publication: ""D’Angelo, F., Ceccarelli, M., Tala et al.

165,197,Exploring the Plexiform Neurofibroma Interactome,syn4939890,syn8449668,Completed,Available,"NF1 mutations in Schwann cells (SCs) drive neurofibroma formation; thus the primary neoplastic cell type in neurofibromas is derived from the SC lineage. The SC genes that are deregulated in mouse and human neurofibromas have not been fully identified. Many cell types are present in neurofibromas besides SCs. These include fibroblasts, mast cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells that are NF1 wild type (as in solitary neurofibroma or in somatic mosaic patients) or NF1 heterozygous (as in many NF1 patients and some mouse models). But how these cells and the intercellular communications contribute to plexiform neurofibroma growth is unknown. It has been recently identified that macrophage is a major cell type in neurofibromas. Macrophages shift gene expression and function in response to the environment, including after nerve injury. Macrophages show anti- tumor effects by secreting free-radicals and recruiting the adaptive immune system (primarily T-cells). However as tumors progress, macrophages stimulate tumor growth and blood vessel formation. Injury-associated inflammation facilitates neurofibroma development by recruiting macrophages in mouse models. How these inter- and intra-cellular interactions contribute to neurofibroma formation has not been studied yet. The goals of this project are to characterize gene expression profiles of Schwann cells and macrophages in mouse nerves and neurofibromas, identify cytokine/chemokine pathways that slow or promote tumor growth and identify molecular networks that mediate intra- and inter-cellular signaling in controlling neurofibroma growth.",NTAP Open Proposal,syn4939890,Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.,"If you use data from this study in a publication or talk, please cite the following publication: ""Choi K, Komurov K, Fletcher JS, Jousma E, Cancelas JA, Wu J, Ratner N.

Our goals were to develop and optimize robust 3D co-culture models of NF1 PNs to allow preclinical drug screening that is both much more representative of likely translational effectiveness than provided by testing in 2D mono-culture, and at a much higher throughput than is available in animal models. Further, we predict that programs such as the NF Clinical Trials Consortium are more likely to be successful if they build on data from robust and representative pre-clinical models.

184,197,Drug-Target Explorer,syn11672851,syn15665015,Active,Available,"Phenotypic high-throughput screens are often utilized in modern oncology drug discovery pipelines. Such screens are conducted with an array of molecules (panels of oncology drugs, drugs for other indications, and compounds with possibly unknown bioactivity), ultimately measuring a biological change within a disease model. While these screens can yield valuable hits, they also present the challenge of identifying the target(s) that mediate the effect seen in the screen for several reasons. For example, many drugs have a polypharmacologic target profile making it hard to identify which targets are biologically relevant for a given drug. Furthermore, some libraries contain molecules for which drug-target studies have never been conducted.

193,197,Optical dopamine monitoring with dLight1 reveals mesolimbic phenotypes in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1.,syn18904024,syn18918530,Completed,Available,"We employed the genetically encoded optical dopamine sensor dLight1 to monitor dopaminergic neurotransmission in the ventral striatum of NF1 mice during motivated behavior. Additionally, we developed novel systemic AAV vectors to facilitate morphological reconstruction of dopaminergic populations in cleared tissue. We found that NF1 mice exhibit reduced spontaneous dopaminergic neurotransmission that was associated with excitation/inhibition imbalance in the ventral tegmental area and abnormal neuronal morphology. Additionally, NF1 mice had more robust dopaminergic and behavioral responses to salient visual stimuli. These phenotypes were reversible, stimulus-dependent, and independent of learning. Overall, these studies provide a first in vivo characterization of dopaminergic circuit function in the context of NF1 and reveal novel pathophysiological mechanisms.",Independent,syn18904024,Accessing the data from this study requires a Synapse account.,"If you use data from this study in a publication or talk, please cite the following publication: ""Robinson JE, Coughlin GM, Hori AM, et al.
